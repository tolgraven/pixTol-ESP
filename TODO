TODO: global function channels:
1 Dimmer (so don't have to emulate it in Afterglow...) - could also go past 100? so boosting everything (obvs clipped to 255/255/255/255) - Compensate for fact that Afterglow won't go over 50/50/50/50% when "maxed", needs lightness 100 I guess?
2 Strobe 
3-5 Strobe Red, Green, Blue
6 Strobe functions - per pixel on/off, time-ratio on/off for strobe, halogen emulationish etc
7 Function channel, toggling:
- Automatic light bleed between pixels?
- Automatic "blur" / afterglow (keep track of past few states for pixel and blend in like)
- Dithering like just small randomness so esp strobe still looks eh, organic or something
- Gamma adjust from pixelbus, toggle?
- neopixelbus - RotateLeft/Right ShiftLeft/Right? for direct sweeps/animations of current state however it was reached... would def allow cool results when activated over dmx
  						 - the NeoBuffer/NeoVerticalPriteSheet/NeoBitmapFile stuff?
- random other shit. WS2812FX etc?  // - set as slave
