// make alpha, pitch to taxify or whatever:
//
// Cars have an LED-strip mounted on rear window.
// Communicates with driver's phone using BT
// When ride requested app elements turn a certain color
// car LEDs turn same color, helping you find your ride

// no extra gear than LED box required,
// app handles everything...

// so, for working pre-alpha:
// - ESP32 with pixTol FW inc code for nice basic "breathing" effect
// - simple Swift module to take color input and send over BLE
// - Appropriate window-mountable, nice-looking exterior
// - Obviously rechargable over USB
// - If driver lacks module, simply indicate as much
//
// Beauty is exteeme cheapness, unifying banding factor/how it indicates
// "this is a car in our fleet", general futuristic look
// (w/ appropriate, subtle, animations), and general simpleness.
